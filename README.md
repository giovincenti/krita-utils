# Krita Utilities

I have found that Krita is a fantastic tool to use in my remote teaching, paired with a Wacom tablet. There are, however, several things that I would like to automate. As a 'fun' project, I decided to write a few scripts that automate the setup and utilization of the tool in my classroom.

## TODO

* Create a new document and save it immediately with the name format 2020-12-25-00-00.kra
* Save all active documents with the original file name and export them automatically to PNG
* Set the brush size and eraser size at startup
