# Simple Krita Scripting

I have found that [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a fantastic tool to use in my remote teaching, paired with a Wacom [Intuos Pro](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos-pro) tablet. There are, however, several things that I would like to automate. I will share my findings and early steps in Krita scripting here, so others may benefit from what I learned as well.

## My Setup

* Lenovo ThinkPad L450
* Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Gnome Classic Mode
* Krita 4.3.0

## TODO

* Create a new document and save it immediately with the name format 2020-12-25-00-00.kra
* Save all active documents with the original file name and export them automatically to PNG
* Set the brush size and eraser size at startup
