# Krita Utilities

I have found that [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a fantastic tool to use in my remote teaching, paired with a Wacom [Intuos Pro](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos-pro) tablet. There are, however, several things that I would like to automate. I will share my findings and early steps in Krita scripting here, so others may benefit from what I learned as well.

## TODO

* Create a new document and save it immediately with the name format 2020-12-25-00-00.kra
